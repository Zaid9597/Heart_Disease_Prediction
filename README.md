# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project analyzed 319,000+ records to predict heart disease using machine learning. Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis were conducted, with models evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression achieved the highest recall, crucial for minimizing false negatives in early detection.
